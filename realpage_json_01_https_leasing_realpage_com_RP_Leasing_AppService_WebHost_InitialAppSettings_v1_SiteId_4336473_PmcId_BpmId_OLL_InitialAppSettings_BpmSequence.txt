Payment Authorization</strong><br>\r\n            You authorize us to hold, receive and disburse funds in accordance with your payment instructions. When you submit a payment transaction through RP Payments,\r\n            you authorize us to debit or credit your designated payment account (ACH, credit card or debit card) and transfer such funds to the designated Payee. RP Payments\r\n            processes your payment and any applicable fees in accordance with your lease and the Payee’s resident portal policies. You agree that anyone you authorize to use\r\n            your RP Payments account may use RP Payments on your behalf and that you will be responsible for any payments made by such person. You understand that an ACH authorization\r\n            will remain in full force and effect until you cancel your payment(s) within the portal at least one business day prior to processing date.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            <strong>5. Transaction Holds and Delays</strong><br>\r\n            We may delay, suspend or reject a payment transaction for any reason including, without limitation, if we suspect the transaction subjects us to financial or security\r\n            risk or is unauthorized, fraudulent, suspicious, unlawful, in violation of these Terms or otherwise subject to dispute or chargeback.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            <strong>6.

Card payments received after 12am midnight CST are processed\r\n            the following business day, not including bank holidays.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            <strong>7.

You must resolve your payment dispute directly with the applicable Payee in accordance with the terms of you lease. RP Payments may, in its sole discretion,\r\n            cancel a payment in process prior to settlement to Payee, but has no obligation to do so.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            <strong>8.
